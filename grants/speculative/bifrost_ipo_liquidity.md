# Bifrost IPO Liquidity

## Project Description
Bifrost is a parachain that provides liquidity for collateral assets. It is positioned as the basic protocol in the Polkadot ecology. Based on the development of substrate, the parachain slot will be auctioned. Staking is the first asset for Bifrost to unlock liquidity. Users can use Bifrost to PoS Such assets can be converted into Bifrost vToken to obtain income and liquidity.

Bifrost plans to provide SLOT DOT liquidity for the Polkadot Parachain Slot Auction. The Bifrost Parachain Slot Auction will be available soon. Because of the limited number of Parachain Slots, the initial price of Parachain Slots is expensive, and most of them are parallel. The chain will conduct the first parachain crowdfunding (IPO) to gain an advantage in the market bidding. At this time, a large number of DOTs will be locked into the parachain slot auction due to parachain incentives, and users will lock the DOT through the original method. You need to wait for the parachain to expire (6-24 months) before it can be redeemed. If the user participates in the parachain slot auction and locks the DOT, he can get vsDOT (Voucher Slot DOT), and hold the vsDOT to get the parachain reward and flow. The transfer of IPO equity can be completed without waiting 6-24 months, and vsDOT will be the second type of pledged asset supported by Bifrost.
